            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hardworking, dedicated and self motivated individual who always strives for the best. I enjoy being able
                to
                be creative and believe fashion and design are universally recognized forms of expression and I love
                being
                able to communicate through these mediums. Through my experience as a designer, I have developed a
                very unique and versatile skill set which I am constantly building on to and improving.
                When not working on my career, I enjoy created DIY/craft projects, spending time with friends and family
                and browsing through social media to catch up on the feeds of my favourite local influencers.</p>
